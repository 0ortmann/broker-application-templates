# Bro-to-App

This folder contains example apps that use `broker` to listen for incoming messages.

The examples in this folder use a `bro` instance to send messages. You must have a `bro` installation, such that you can run the `.bro` scripts. The scripts will instruct `bro` to send `broker` messages and print or log something.
